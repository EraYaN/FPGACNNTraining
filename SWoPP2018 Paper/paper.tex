\begin{abstract}
The race for larger and deeper neural networks are leading researchers, vendors and practitioners to re-think architectural design decisions taken decades ago in hope to improve performance.
Among these decisions, reducing the numerical format is thought to be one of prime candidates to increasing performance.
Unfortunately, modern hardware has limited support for this, and the impact of modifying floating-point formats and its size remains shrouded in mystery.
To help investigate what the effects of varying the precision during deep-learning training are, first an architecture using reconfigurable hardware needs to be developed.
Through this work, we seek to accelerate arbitrary precision deep-learning training using Field-Programmable Gate-Arrays by leveraging Intel FPGA SDK for OpenCL.
Preliminary results show promise for implementations based on precisions or number formats that currently only have low performing implementations on conventional CPU and GPU hardware.
